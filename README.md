## 📬 Gmail Setup

### Option A — Local (browser login)

1. Go to **Settings → Connect Gmail**
2. Log in to Gmail in the Chrome window that opens
3. Session is saved automatically — done

### Option B — Cloud / Headless (upload session file)

> Use this for CF/TAS where no display server is available.

**Step 1** — Capture session locally:
```bash
# Method 1: Run the JAR locally
java -jar target/campaign-manager-1.0.0.jar
# → Settings → Connect Gmail → login → session saved to ./data/gmail-session.json

# Method 2: Node.js script (no Java needed)
npm install playwright && npx playwright install chromium
node scripts/capture-gmail-session.js
```

**Step 2** — Upload to cloud app:
- Settings page → **Upload Session File** → select `gmail-session.json`

> ⚠️ The session is stored in the container's ephemeral filesystem — re-upload after each CF restart.

## 📊 Import Format

### Spreadsheet (one row = one contact)

Auto-detected when the sheet has both an **`Email Link`** and **`Email 1`** column.

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Name` | ✅ | Full name |
| `Email` | ✅ | Email address (upsert key) |
| `Title` | | Job title → `{{title}}` token |
| `Phone` | | Phone number |
| `Play` | | Sales play (e.g. Tanzu) |
| `Sub Play` | | Sub-play |
| `AE/SA` | | Role designation |
| `Email Link` | ✅ | Google Doc URL with 7 email sections |
| `Email 1`–`Email 7` | ✅ | Send date/time per step (Eastern Time) |
| `Opt Out` | | `Y` = skip this row entirely |

**Supported date formats:** `2/26/2026 9:00:00` · `2026-02-26 09:00` · `2/26/26 9:00`

---

### Google Doc Format (Email Link column)

Each contact's Google Doc holds up to 7 email sections. Fetched at import time using the connected Gmail session — no separate OAuth needed.

```
Email 1: Initial Outreach
Subject: Quick question about {{play}}, {{name}}
Hi {{name}},

I wanted to reach out about your {{play}} initiatives...

Best,
Brian
—

Email 2: Follow-Up
Subject: Following up, {{name}}
Hi {{name}},

Just circling back...

Best,
Brian

```

#### Parsing rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Section start** | Line beginning with `Email N` (case-insensitive, N = 1–7) |
| **Subject** | First line starting with `Subject:` — prefix stripped |
| **Subject fallback** | If no `Subject:` line, first line of section is used |
| **Inline greeting split** | `Hi / Hello / Dear + Capital` in the subject splits it — greeting onward becomes body |
| **Trailing separators** | `—`, `---`, `===`, `***`, blank lines at section end are stripped |
| **Unicode** | BOM, zero-width spaces, non-breaking spaces normalized automatically |
| **Missing date = skip** | If `Email N` column is blank, that section is not imported |

#### Personalization tokens

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| `{{name}}` / `{{Name}}` | Contact name |
| `{{title}}` / `{{Title}}` | Job title |
| `{{role}}` | Job title |
| `{{company}}` | Company |
| `{{play}}` | Play field |

---

## ☁️ Cloud Foundry Deployment

```bash
mvn package -DskipTests
cp target/campaign-manager-1.0.0.jar dist/campaign-manager-1.0.0.jar
cf push
```

#### Key manifest settings

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `memory` | 2G | Chromium needs headroom |
| `TZ` | `America/New_York` | Dates entered in Eastern Time |
| `PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS` | `true` | No display server on CF |
| `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` | `cloud` | Auto-binds MySQL via `VCAP_SERVICES` |

#### Persistent database (recommended)

```bash
cf create-service p.mysql db-small campaign-db
cf bind-service sh-campaign-manager campaign-db
cf restage sh-campaign-manager
```

Without a bound database, H2 is used and data is lost on every restart.

#### Known CF limitations

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| H2 + Gmail session wiped on restart | Bind MySQL; re-upload session after restart |
| "Connect Gmail" unavailable | Settings page shows Upload Session File instead |
| First boot slow (~60s) | Chromium downloads ~120 MB + system libs on first start |

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

**All jobs SKIPPED after import**
→ Dates in your sheet are in the past (Eastern Time). Update `Email 1`–`Email 7` to future dates and re-import with Replace. Or use **Send Now** on individual SKIPPED jobs.

**Google Doc fetch fails**
→ Ensure the Gmail session is active (Settings → Connected). The doc must be accessible by the connected Google account (owned or shared with it).

**Emails not sending after Gmail connected**
→ Check Email Jobs tab — FAILED jobs show the error. Session may have expired; go to Settings → Disconnect → reconnect or re-upload session.

**Gmail session lost after CF restart**
→ CF containers are ephemeral. Re-upload `gmail-session.json` via Settings after every redeploy.

**CF startup: `Host system is missing dependencies`**
→ `PlaywrightSystemDepsInstaller` handles this automatically. Check logs for `extracted N packages`. If N=0, check CF egress/network rules.

## 🔒 Security

- Passwords hashed with **BCrypt**
- Gmail credentials **never stored** — only the Playwright session cookie file
- JWT tokens expire after 1 hour
- H2 console disabled on CF (`application-cloud.properties`)
